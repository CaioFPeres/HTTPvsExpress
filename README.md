# HTTPvsExpress

This repository shows how to host/serve a website with Nodejs, using HTTP/HTTPS Node Module as opposed to Express.
The website can have been either created with regular html files or React.

It should be mentioned that as of right now this is just a prototype to understand the basic idea of a webserver, and doesn't provide all functionalities for production (reading files can be exploited).
